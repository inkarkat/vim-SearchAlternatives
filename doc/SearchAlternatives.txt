DESCRIPTION				      *SearchAlternatives-description*

This plugin provides mappings and commands to add and subtract alternative
branches to the current search pattern. Currently searching for "foo," but
also want to find matches for "bar"? You could type /foo\|bar<CR> or
/<C-R>/\|bar<CR>, but once you want to limit the search to whole \<words\>
(like the |star| command), and juggle several alternatives, adding and
dropping them as you search, this plugin is quicker than manually editing the
search command-line (which you can still do).

RELATED WORKS								     *

- Add to Word Search (vimscript #3955) can add the keyword under the cursor to
  the search pattern and search forward / backward like * / #.

==============================================================================
USAGE						    *SearchAlternatives-usage*
								   *<Leader>+*
<Leader>+		Add the current whole \<word\> as an alternative to the
			search pattern, similar to the |star| command.
								  *<Leader>g+*
<Leader>g+		Add the current word as an alternative to the search
			pattern, similar to the |gstar| command.
							   *{Visual}<Leader>+*
{Visual}<Leader>+	Add the current selection as an alternative to the
			search pattern.
			For a |blockwise-visual| selection, each line of the
			block (minus leading and trailing whitespace) is added
			as a separate alternative search pattern. When the
			first selected line of the block is surrounded by non-
			keyword characters, the match is done with \<...\>.
			If the |blockwise-visual| selection is only comprised
			of a single line, all WORDs of that line are added as
			separate alternative whole \<word\> search patterns.

								   *<Leader>-*
<Leader>-		Remove the current whole \<word\> from the alternatives
			in the search pattern.
								  *<Leader>g-*
<Leader>g-		Remove the current word from the alternatives in the
			search pattern.
							   *{Visual}<Leader>-*
{Visual}<Leader>-	Remove the current selection from the alternatives in
			the search pattern.
			For a |blockwise-visual| selection, this has the same
			special behavior as |{Visual}<Leader>+|.

								  *:SearchAdd*
:SearchAdd {expr}	Add {expr} as an alternative to the search pattern.
							       *:SearchRemove*
:SearchRemove {expr}	Remove {expr} from the alternatives in the search
			pattern.
:[N]SearchRemove	Remove the [N]'th / last alternative from the
			alternatives in the search pattern.

INSTALLATION				     *SearchAlternatives-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-SearchAlternatives
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchAlternatives*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				     *SearchAlternatives-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.035 or
  higher.

HISTORY						  *SearchAlternatives-history*

1.11	RELEASEME
- Abort :SearchRemove command on error.
- ENH: When adding a pattern (e.g. /foo/) when a shorter prefix (/fo/) already
  exists, the shorter one will eclipse the longer one (only "fo" will be
  matched in "foobar"). A new algorithm determines / estimates (in case of
  multis) the match length, and adds shorter ones after longer ones, to avoid
  the problem. In case of varying match lengths (e.g. with * and \+ multis),
  it cannot completely fix it, but it's always equal or better than the
  original simple addition at the end.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.035! ***

1.10	19-Jul-2013
- ENH: Blockwise <Leader>+ / <Leader>- add / remove each partial selected
  trimmed line as a separate search alternative, or individual words when a
  single line is blockwise-selected.
- ENH: Implement command completion that offers existing alternatives (to
  remove or clone-and-modify them).
- Remove -complete=expression; it's not useful for completing regexp patterns.
- Add dependency to ingo-library (vimscript #4433). *** You need to separately
  install ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.009 (or higher)! ***
